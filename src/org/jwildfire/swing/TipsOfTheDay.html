You have some nice gradient, but a small part is odd? Enter <b>Gradient</b>-tab and press the <b>Edit gradient</b> button.<br>
Move the left color-marker to the left of the part of the gradient you want to remove.<br>
Move the right color-marker to the right of the part of the gradient you want to remove.
Press the <b>Fade</b>-button, now left colors is faded to right, and the odd part is removed.

<h3>Tip 003: Java heap space</h3>
The common error "Java heap space" means the software ran out of memory.<br><br>
The software only uses the amount of memory you specify in the launcher. So, often it makes sense to start the program
again and increase the value "memory to use" in the launcher (if your system has memory left)<br><br>
To reduce the required amount of memory you may reduce the render-resolution.<br>

<h3>Tip 004: Solid rendering</h3>
When realtime-editing of a flame with solid-rendering appears too slow, just turn off solid rendering temporarily. 
Continue editing and finally turn in on again to proceed.<br>
This works especially good for editing DOF-setting. Because they appear in non-solid-mode in realtime, while DOF 
is a post-processing-effect in solid-rendering-mode, i. e. does not appear in realtime-editing.

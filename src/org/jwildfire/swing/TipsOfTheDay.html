<h3>Tip 003: Java heap space</h3>
The common error "Java heap space" means the software ran out of memory.<br><br>
The software only uses the amount of memory you specify in the launcher. So, often it makes sense to start the program
again and increase the value "memory to use" in the launcher (if your system has memory left)<br><br>
To reduce the required amount of memory you may reduce the render-resolution.<br>

<hr>Tips for Apophysis users<br>

<b>Translating Apo-tutorials from Apo to JWildfire  </b><br>
You will be able to adopt nearly any Apo-tutorial to JWildfire. There are some rare exceptions, e. g. missing/different variations ("Plugins").
Here is a list with common questions/answers when trying to adopting an Apo-tutorial:
<ul>
<li>To add a linked transform use "L"-button right of the "Add"-transform-button
<li>When you use Xaos, you can use only the "From"-view in JWildfire, there is currently no "To"-view. 
But please note that this "To"-view is actually not needed, you can completely control and understand Xaos by just using 
the "From"-view, the "To"-view is just a shortcut to do some thing with a fewer clicks. The "From"-view is the view on the Xaos-tab.
</ul>

<b>Exchanging Parameters (using the clipboard) </b><br>
JWildfire also supports exchanging parameters by using the clipboard, and the best thing about this is: it also "understands" most of the Apo-parameters.  
But, you cant use the keyboard-shortcuts you know from Apo. Instead use the buttons "To Clipboard" (store params of the current flame into the clipboard, &lt; Ctrl &gt; + C in Apo)
and "From Clipboard" (try to import the current content of the Clipboard as flame, &lt; Ctrl ;gt; + V in Apo) 

<b>Sliders and Number Fields :</b><br>
Note that most numeric fields in JWildfire allow to modify values by dragging the mouse (similar to using a slider). 
Just the enter the field with the mouse, hold the left button and drag the mouse left or right to decrease/increase numeric values.

<b>Navigating triangles using cursor keys:</b><br>
If the preview area is active and you have selected a triangle you may modify this triangle using 
the cursor keys (Because the cursor keys have also other functions (e. g. navigating in tables) you have to focus the preview 
are with the mouse at first): 
<ul>
<li><b>Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> normal move triangle (with the specified step)  
<li><b>Shift + Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> fast move triangle (10 times as the specified step)  
<li><b>Ctrl + Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> slow move triangle (0.1 times as the specified step)
<li><b>Alt + Cursor Left | Right:</b> rotate triangle counter-clockwise | clockwise 
<li><b>Alt + Cursor Up | Down:</b> enlarge | shrink triangle 
</ul>

<b>Changing values by directly entering numbers</b> <br>
Usually most of the parameters are changed by dragging the mouse, navigating triangles using the keyboard or using special buttons.
But in the most cases it is also possible to enter numeric values directly.<br> 
<b>Please note that you have to finish the editing by pressing &lt; Enter &gt; that it takes effect.</b> (This will is not very 
intuitive and will change in one of the next releases)<br>
 
<b>Navigating triangles using cursor keys:</b><br>
If the preview area is active and you have selected a triangle you may modify this triangle using 
the cursor keys (Because the cursor keys have also other functions (e. g. navigating in tables) you have to focus the preview 
are with the mouse at first): 
<ul>
<li><b>Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> normal move triangle (with the specified step)  
<li><b>Shift + Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> fast move triangle (10 times as the specified step)  
<li><b>Ctrl + Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> slow move triangle (0.1 times as the specified step)
<li><b>Alt + Cursor Left | Right:</b> rotate triangle counter-clockwise | clockwise 
<li><b>Alt + Cursor Up | Down:</b> enlarge | shrink triangle 
</ul>

<hr>INTERACTIVE RENDERER</hr><br>
The interactive renderer serves two purposes:
<ul>
<li> Explore random fractals in a really funny way. You can now follow the rendering of a fractal. 
If you have seen enough just press the NEXT button to get a new randomly generated flame. 
If you like it you can save it or copy it to the clipboard to tweak it in the main editor.
Of course, you can load or paste any (non random) fractal into the interactive renderer.   
<li> WYSIWYG: Render an image until you are satisfied. Here is no oversampling applied. 
You can save the image all the time while it still rendering. So you can have a closer look at it to see if its really done, e.g. in a image processing software.  
</ul>
But beware, the interactive renderer never stops automatically and will render until hell freezes :-)  You must always stop it manually or finish the program.

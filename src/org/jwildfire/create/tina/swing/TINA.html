<b>Changing values by directly entering numbers</b> <br>
Usually most of the parameters are changed by dragging the mouse, navigating triangles using the keyboard or using special buttons.
But in the most cases it is also possible to enter numeric values directly.<br> 
<b>Please note that you have to finish the editing by pressing &lt; Enter &gt; that it takes effect.</b> (This will is not very 
intuitive and will change in one of the next releases)<br>
 
<b>Navigating triangles using cursor keys:</b><br>
If the preview area is active and you have selected a triangle you may modify this triangle using 
the cursor keys (Because the cursor keys have also other functions (e. g. navigating in tables) you have to focus the preview 
are with the mouse at first): 
<ul>
<li><b>Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> normal move triangle (with the specified step)  
<li><b>Shift + Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> fast move triangle (10 times as the specified step)  
<li><b>Ctrl + Cursor Left | Right | Up | Down:</b> slow move triangle (0.1 times as the specified step)
<li><b>Alt + Cursor Left | Right:</b> rotate triangle counter-clockwise | clockwise 
<li><b>Alt + Cursor Up | Down:</b> enlarge | shrink triangle 
</ul>

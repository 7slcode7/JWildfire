Please use always the official launcher to start JWildfire.

Either use start.bat, start.sh or start the j-wildfire-launcher.jar directly.

If you start the j-wildfire.jar directly then JWildfire is started with default Java otions. 
In the most cases you cannot render large images with those settings because not enough memory 
is reserved at startup. So even if you have plenty of memory it can not be used for rendering this way.
Additionally, the wrong settings may cause slower rendering.

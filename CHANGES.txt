V0.68 (14.04.2013):
 - re-implemented the script-tab: scripts are now maintained in a folder-like structure. There are two main folders: "Built-in scripts" (examples) and "Your scripts". The latter points to an arbitrary folder on your harddisc and holds your own scripts. You can easily create and copy scripts either using the new functions in JWildfire or by just copying/creating them manually. Additionally, scripts now always contain of two files: the description (plain text) and the code (Java code)   
 - added most of the recent scripts from the JWildfire Open Group as examples
 - new path for scripts in the Preferences editor, moved the old script path (for the animation editor) into a new "Misc" category
 - added the possibility to delete flame files from within the file dialog
 - added (again) separate buttons for moving, rotating and scaling of triangles (but using the move button you still have the possibility to rotate with the right mouse button and to scale with the middle mouse button)

 - updated the link to the new JWildfire Open Group in the welcome-screen

V0.67 (20.03.2013):
 - MutaGen: an amazing new module to interactively create mutations of a certain flame. 
   There are several mutation types affecting different "genes" (types of flame properties). 
   Those mutations are applied at two levels: generation A (8 new fractals from the base flame) and generation B (16 new fractals from generation A), 
   generating total 24 new flames at each mutation step.  
   You can easily exchange fractals between the main editor and the new module at any time. 
   Unlike to many other programs of this type, there is a true history, i.e. you can navigate back to earlier generations at any time. 
   Even if there are so many possible parameter combinations which may lead to singularies and huge computation times, the programm 
   achieves predictable computation times for each whole generation. This is done by delegating the mutation process to separate threads 
   and eventually just killing them.
 - new "sintrange" variaton by Ffey
 - new "Sort" button on the gradient transform tab (to create a new gradient which is sorted by hue and luminance)
